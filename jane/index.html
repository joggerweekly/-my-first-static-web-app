<h1>Welcome to Ms. Hang's Math Class</h1>
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:Orange;">Orange</h1>
<p>I	want	to	begin	this	year	by	letting	you	know	a	little	bit	what	you	can	expect	from	this	class. You	can	expect	me	to	come	to	class	each	day,	prepared	and	happy	to	teach.	You	can	expect	me	to	see	
you	as	an	individual	with	both	strengths	and	weaknesses	and	for	me	to	maintain	a	classroom	that	is	both relaxed	and	rigorous.	You	can	expect	me	to	challenge	you	and	myself.	I	expect	you	to	be	in	your	seat	when	
the	bell	rings	with	a	positive	attitude	and	all	your	materials	at	hand.	I	expect	you	to	treat	me	and	all	your classmates	with	courtesy	and	respect.	I	expect	you	to	challenge	yourself	and	me.	I	trust	this	will	be	a	class	
you	enjoy	and	that	we	will	learn	and	laugh	each	day	along	the way.</p>
